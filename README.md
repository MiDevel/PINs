# General description

PINs is a free feature-rich Windows program for safe and
comfortable storing of any secure information like passwords,
accounts, PINs etc. PINs uses a secure 448 bit Blowfish
algorithm to ensure the data are not crackable. The password
used for securing access to stored data is not saved anywhere.
PINs is equipped in a number of security functions like files
wiping.

PINs runs under any 32-bit Windows. It does not require
installation and does not need any special dlls, drivers or
system files which can mess up your system. This means that PINs
can run directly from floppy - including data files - without
installing anything. This is extremely useful if you wish to
easily access your data on other computers as well.

DON'T FORGET YOUR PINs PASSWORD! I won't be able to recover it
for you (nobody will...)
